## 👋 About Me

<p>
I’m an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional and CompTIA PenTest+ certified Senior Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience bridging <strong>Data Engineering, Cloud Security, and Product Security</strong>.  
At <a href="https://www.garmin.com/">Garmin International</a>, I architect and automate secure data pipelines integrating <strong>telemetry, SBOM, and compliance datasets</strong> across AWS and Databricks, enabling analytics, auditability, and <strong>CRA / EU RED readiness</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Previously, I developed scalable analytics frameworks at <a href="https://ensoftcorp.com/">EnSoft Corp</a> and contributed to <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/space-time-analysis-for-cybersecurity">DARPA’s Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC)</a> program at <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a>, where I co-authored award-winning research in static analysis and machine learning–based vulnerability detection.
</p>

<p>
Passionate about uniting <strong>Data Engineering, AI, and Product Security</strong>, I build <strong>cloud-native, GenAI-powered, and compliance-ready platforms</strong> that transform security data into intelligence—driving resilience, automation, and innovation at scale.
