## 🧠 Automated On-Demand Context-Specific Documentation  
**Authors:** Ahmed Tamrawi, Sharwan Ram, Payas Awadhutkar, Ganesh Ram Santhanam, Benjamin Holland, Suresh Kothari  
**Venue:** [IEEE ICSME 2018 – DySDoc3, Madrid, Spain](https://dysdoc.github.io/dysdoc3/index.html)  
🏆 *Received Best Challenge Entry Award*  

**Abstract:**  
DynaDoc is an automated documentation system for on-demand, context-specific documentation.  
It leverages **graph database technology** with an **eXtensible Common Software Graph Schema (XCSG)** to efficiently mine program artifacts and link them to commits, issues, and other metadata.  
This approach enables semantically rich documentation for millions of lines of source code, enhancing software comprehension and developer productivity.
