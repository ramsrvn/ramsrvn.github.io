Open the terminal and run the following command:

**sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine < path to the extracted files >**

For example, let say we downloaded the bundle in the Downloads folder and we extracted it there. Now run the following command:

**sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/EnSoft-Atlas-macos+SDKPlus-3.7.1/Eclipse.app/**
