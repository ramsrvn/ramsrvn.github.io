# Selected Projects

This page highlights a mix of **industry**, **research**, and **security-focused** projects that combine my expertise in **data engineering, cloud architecture, and program analysis**.

---

## ☁️ Data Compliance Lakehouse (Garmin)
Designed and implemented an **AWS + Databricks Lakehouse** architecture integrating telemetry, SBOM, and compliance datasets across 250+ product lines.  
- Built distributed **ETL pipelines** using **PySpark, Delta Lake, and AWS Glue** for ingestion and curation.  
- Automated regulatory reporting pipelines for **EU RED / CRA compliance** using metadata governance frameworks.  
- Developed **Tableau dashboards** for vulnerability analytics, data lineage, and compliance visualization.  
- Tuned **Spark SQL performance** and cluster configurations, improving query speeds 3× and reducing compute cost by $120K annually.  

**Tech Stack:** Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, AWS Glue, Redshift, Step Functions, Tableau, S3, Airflow  

---

## 🤖 GenAI-Powered Compliance Insights (Garmin)
Developed **AI-driven data processing workflows** using **AWS Bedrock and OpenAI APIs** to extract insights from compliance and regulatory documents.  
- Automated tagging, classification, and summarization of product compliance reports using **LLM-based pipelines**.  
- Integrated with **Databricks notebooks** and **Delta tables** to enable semantic search across vulnerability datasets.  
- Reduced manual review effort by 40%, increasing audit traceability and governance accuracy.  

**Tech Stack:** AWS Bedrock, OpenAI APIs, LangChain, Databricks, Python, Redshift, Delta Lake  

---

## 🧩 SBOM Pipeline Automation (Garmin)
Engineered automated pipelines to generate and analyze **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** across multi-platform builds — including Waf, Zephyr, Android, and Yocto.  
- Designed orchestration flows with **AWS Step Functions** and **Glue** to unify SBOM ingestion into **Databricks Delta Lakes**.  
- Enabled near-real-time vulnerability tracking, CVE mapping, and compliance lineage dashboards using **Tableau**.  
- Contributed to Garmin’s **EU RED / CRA readiness** initiative by ensuring traceability of open-source components and dependencies.  

**Tech Stack:** Databricks, PySpark, AWS Glue, Redshift, Tableau, CycloneDX, Airflow

## 🧠 Software Complexity Analyzer
An **Eclipse plugin** designed to measure software complexity efficiently. Implemented a **linear-time algorithm** to count program paths — a major improvement over prior polynomial methods.  

---

## 🔁 Loop ToolBox
[**LoopToolBox**](https://github.com/kcsl/LoopModel) is an Eclipse-based static analysis tool that classifies **Linux kernel loops** from a **security perspective**. It identifies lock/unlock and memory allocation/deallocation behaviors to pinpoint concurrency and resource vulnerabilities.  

---

## 💧 Memory Leak Analyzer
Developed a **Java-based Eclipse plugin** for automated memory leak detection in C and Java software. The tool discovered critical issues in **Apache POI**, **Kerberos**, and **Linux subsystems**, improving their stability and reliability.  

---

## 📘 Apache DynaDoc
[**Apache DynaDoc**](https://github.com/EnSoftCorp/DynaDoc) automatically generates **context-specific program documentation**.  
- Recognized with the **Best Challenge Entry Award** at *IEEE DySDoc3 (Madrid, Spain, 2018)*.  
- Integrated with **Apache Atlas** and **Eclipse plugins**, enabling on-demand, dynamic documentation.  

---

## 🧩 Atlas Plugin Contributions
Contributed to **program analysis APIs** within the [**Atlas Framework**](http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/).  

- [**Toolbox Commons**](https://ensoftcorp.github.io/toolbox-commons/): Reusable utilities for static analysis with Atlas.  
- [**ICFG PCG Toolbox**](https://github.com/EnSoftCorp/pcg-toolbox/tree/ICFG-IPCG): Built APIs for **inter-procedural control flow graph generation**, enabling large-scale software behavior tracing.
